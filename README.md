<p>Sound data is personal project I started recently and on which I am currently working on my free time.
The idea is to create a web application through which a user would be able to upload an audio file in order to get musical informations about it such as: the tempo (bpm), the length in minutes of the file and a graphical representation of the sound.<p/>
<p>Currently working on an Minimum Viable Product, my goal for the V2 of <strong>Sound Data</strong> is to add the possibility to create an account in order to save the infos of a user's previously analyzed files, so they won't have to upload their files again.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The back-end (ongoing) is done in Python with the use of Flask for the building of the API's routes.</li>
  <li>
    The audio-files are processed through a python package named <strong>Librosa</strong> which is specifically designed for music and audio analysis.       </li>
  <li>The front-end (ongoing) is created with the use of React.js and Tailwind.css. </li>
  <li>In the V2, I am planning to add a MySQL relational database to handle user's account data and the saving of files' slugs.</li>
</ul>
